/* TODO: we should implement File in such a way we can iterate recursively. This will make things significantly easier and more efficient. For now however I'll leave it as is, just to get things figured out and working. After I've gotten everything barely working, I'll start refining and polishing things (including implementing resursion where possible, such as with file navigation).

    /* TODO:
    We need to support directories. Ideally we will just create files in local storage and display the directory structure, this way users can access these files from other devices outside of the application via services such as iCloud. When we save the link to a file instead of downloading it, we can provide a spreadsheet or some other such thing in the directory (unless we can somehow link to remote resources within the file system). However, we should also provide the ability to read and work with spreadsheets within the app (in the future), so the implementation may differ.
     
     Using CoreData may also make sense but I'm not sure yet how I want to implement this. With CoreData I'm not sure how easy it will be to share directories outside the app, but I imagine it would make keeping track of remote files, tags, and flags easier; though it'll depend somewhat on what features the filesystem supports.
     
     Need to look into constraints so we can enforce them in the data type.
